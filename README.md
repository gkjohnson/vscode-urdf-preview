# URDF Viewer VSCode Extension

An extension for viewing and testing a URDF file. Based on the [URDFLoader](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders/) for THREE.js.

The 3D view reloads as the URDF file is edited and can only load geometry files and textures from within the current VSCode workspace.

## TODO

- Create README image
- Create an icon for the extension
- Create an icon for toggling the 3D view
- Display errors
- Validate against URDF schema file before display
